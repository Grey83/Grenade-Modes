# SourceMod Plugin - Grenade Modes (or Nademodes)

## Description

The grenades can be configured with different modes, providing the ability to use them for example as proximity mines.

There're currently 4 grenade modes:
* Normal (Classic)
* Impact (Explode after any contact)
* Proximity (Explode when a enemy is near)
* Lasermine (Explode when a enemy crosses the laser)

The mode can be configurated per grenade type using the command "*+lookatweapon*" (F by default). 

The color of the effects (Beacon, laser..) depends if the grenade is thrown from a teammate or an enemy. 

For the moment, only the **hegrenade**, **flashbang** and **smokegrenade** are supported. 
The decoy, incendiary and tactical grenades will be supported in the future.

## Cvars

These cvars work in real time: it's not necessary to restart the round to apply a new value.
